# Python Course: Exploring, Transforming, and Visualizing Data Tables with Pandas in Python.

This repository contains the materials and examples used in an introductory course on **Pandas** and other libraries from the Python scientific ecosystem.  
All functions and methods demonstrated in the course are explicitly referenced to the **official documentation** within the notebook itself, ensuring accuracy and encouraging further learning.  
The dataset used for the data visualization examples, **`pokemon.csv`**, is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/pokemon).

The goal of this course is to provide formation for working with tabular data, performing data analysis operations, and generating visualizations efficiently.

## Main topics

- Introduction to `pandas.DataFrame` and `pandas.Series`  
- Reading and writing data (Excel, CSV, etc.)  
- Data selection, filtering, and transformation  
- Descriptive statistics and common operations  
- Data visualization with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**  
- Integration with **NumPy** for advanced calculations  

## Technologies used

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)  
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)  
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)  
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)  
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)  

## How to run

You can open the notebook directly in Google Colab:

1. Upload the `.ipynb` file to your Google Drive.  
2. Open it using Google Colaboratory.  
3. If running locally, make sure to install all required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
